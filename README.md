Sir everthing was completed in class within 8:30 PM.
I made this repo in the class.
My github was not working as I did not have gitbash installed before, the repo I made duirng 7:10 pm which is this one made was by uploading using the site of Github
Later i installed and added github in VS Code.
It initialized a new repo which is this one: https://github.com/ashimnepal/ecommerce.git
The given repo(https://github.com/ashimnepal/ecommerce.git) has all the commit times and commit changes in it but the repo that you are reading this Readme.md in was submitted by me in the class which was made in 7:10 pm
VS code initialized a new repo for the work that i completed in class within 1 hour 30 minutes of first commit message i did in this repo.
I later changed the files in this repo and added the completed file in this repo as i submitted this repo during 7:10 pm

For time references and commits done please see https://github.com/ashimnepal/ecommerce.git
This repo is being updated as i submitted you this repo in class


There is one repo CIA which i misunderstood and submitted the repo which i am deleting as i understood that CIA was to be submitted.

For further clarifications or reasoning please email me
